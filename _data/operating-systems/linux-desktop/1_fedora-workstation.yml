  <strong>Fedora Workstation</strong> is our recommendation for users new to Linux.
  
  The distribution has a semi-rolling release cycle. While some packages like GNOME are frozen until the next Fedora release, most packages - including the kernel - are updated very frequently throughout a life span of a release. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months. Fedora comes with mostly sane defaults out of the box.

  Fedora tends to be an early adopter of new technologies such as <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>, <a href="https://pipewire.org/">PipeWire</a>, and soon, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FsVerityRPM">FS-Verity</a>. These new technologies often come with major improvements in security, privacy, and usability. 

  Fedora only offers free software in it's official repositories with the exception of firmware and microcode updates. For proprietary packages, the user could get them from <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/">RPMFusion</a> (a very popular and generally trusted repository) or <a href="https://flathub.org">FlatHub</a> (the de-facto leader of <a href="https://www.flatpak.org">Flatpak</a> packages distribution). Fedora also has <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/">COPR</a>, and automated package build service. However, this is rarely needed as most packages are already available through RPMFusion, and packages on COPR can be uploaded by any user at any time.
