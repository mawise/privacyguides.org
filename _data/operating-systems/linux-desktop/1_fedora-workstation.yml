  <strong>Fedora Workstation</strong> is our recommendation distribution for users new to Linux.

  The distribution has a semi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a> cycle. While some packages like GNOME are frozen until the next Fedora release, most packages - including the kernel - are updated very frequently throughout a life span of a release. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months.

  Fedora tends to be an early adopter of new technologies such as <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>, <a href="https://pipewire.org/">PipeWire</a>, and soon, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FsVerityRPM">FS-Verity</a>. These new technologies often come with improvements in security, privacy, and usability in general.
