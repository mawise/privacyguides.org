  <strong>openSUSE Tumbleweed</strong> stable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a> distribution.

  Tumbleweed follows a rolling release model, each update is released as a snapshot of the distribution. When the user upgrades their system, a new snapshot is downloaded. Each snapshot is run through a series of automated tests by the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">openSUSE Build Service</a> to ensure its quality.

  openSUSE Tumbleweed has a <a href="https://kubic.opensuse.org/blog/2018-04-04-transactionalupdates/">transactional update</a> system that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a> and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Snapper_Tutorial">Snapper</a> to ensure that snapshots can be rolled back, should there be a problem.
