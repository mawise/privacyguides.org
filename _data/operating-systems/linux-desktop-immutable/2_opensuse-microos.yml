  <strong>openSUSE MicroOS</strong> is an advanced immutable variant of openSUSE with a strong focus on container workflows.

  openSUSE MicroOS is based on openSUSE Tumbleweed and is released together with it. If either Tumbleweed or MicroOS does not pass the quality checks by the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">openSUSE Build Service</a>, both variants will not get their new release until the issues are fixed.

  MicroOS take's Tumbleweed's transactional update system and turn it into an atomic one. For each update, MicroOS creates a new read-write BTRFS snapshot of its current system, apply the changes to the new BTRFS snapshot, then reboot to the new snapshot and mount it as read-only.

  <a href="https://www.flatpak.org">Flatpak</a> is the primary package installation method on openSUSE MicroOS, as operating system is meant to be modified as little as possible. Alternatively, the user can use <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/containers_toolbox/attachments/slides/4564/export/events/attachments/containers_toolbox/slides/4564/By_the_Power_of_Toolbox_Faggioli_FOSDEM21.pdf">Toolbox</a> to create <a href="https://podman.io">Podman</a> containers with a shared home directory with the host operating system and mimic a traditional openSUSE environment.
