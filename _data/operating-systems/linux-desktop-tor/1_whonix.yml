  <strong>Whonix</strong> is based on <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a>, security-focused fork of Debian. It aims to provide privacy, security and anonymity on the internet. 
  
  Whonix is meant to run as two virtual machines, a "Workstation" and a Tor "Gateway". All communications from the Workstation has to go through the Tor gateway, and will be routed through the Tor Network.

  Some of its features include Tor Stream Isolation, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization#Kloak">keystroke anonymization</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/swap-file-creator">encrypted swap</a>, hardened memory allocator, and so on.

  Most interestingly, they are currently working on creating <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything">full system Apparmor policies</a> and a <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sandbox-app-launcher">sandbox app launcher</a> to fully confine all processes on the system.
